## Open Library

#### Task Description

Create a page to search books. For search API use this endpoint:
http://openlibrary.org/search.json.
There should be an input field and a button on the page. Input field is for entering book
name and button is for searching(something like google). To search for the entered book
you should add a parameter to the endpoint, like this: http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=
. If the name of the book consists of several parts like: “The lord of the rings”, then as a
parameter its value should be the+lord+of+the +rings.
So the final look of the endpoint when searching should be
http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=the+lord+.of+the+rings
After getting the result the following information should be shown: Total count of results
(numFound).
The list of the results with the following fields:

Title  
Author Name  
First publish year  
Subject (only first 5 items)

** Create pagination for this list.
The information about pages count you can get using numFound and the f act that one
page contains 100 results. Having that create a pagination for the list. To get information of
the other pages use the following endpoint format:
http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=&page=
